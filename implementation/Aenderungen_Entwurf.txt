Action:	Rename: GraphMLImporter -> GraphmlImporter
Reason:	Match Conventions (no more than 1 capital letter in abreviations)

Action: Added Generics to Raw-Types: VertexFilter and EdgeFilter
Reason: Create more type-safety during compile-time.

Action: Moved method getGraphBuilder from IVertexBuilder to IGraphBuilder
Reason: Better possibility to build hierarchical graphs dynamically

Action: Collabsable Graph Interface hinzugefügt 
Reason: unterscheiden zwischen einem compoundgraph(z.B. FieldAccess) und einem normalen zusammengeklappten subgraphen

Action: JoanaBuilder Abhängigkeiten hinzugefügt
Reason: Damit jeder Builder weiß von wem er erstellt wurde und sein Produkt bei diesem platzieren kann.

Action: Added AbstractPluginBase
Reason: Many functions in the concrete Plugins are nearly empty, but have to be overwritten. An AbstractPluginBase reduces identical code.

Action: Changed method return type of reverseEdge(SugiyamaEdge edge) in ICycleRemoverGraph from Set<SugiyamaEdge> to void
Reason: Not really necessary to know which edges have been turned, it can be queried from the edge throug an instance of a SugiyamaGraph

Action: Added AbstractPluginBase
Reason: Many functions in the concrete Plugins are nearly empty, but have to be overwritten. An AbstractPluginBase reduces identical code. (Lucas)

Action: Removed build() functions from IGraphBuilder, IVertexBuilder, IEdgeBuilder.
Reason: build() is now only called on IGraphModelBuilder, which then calls recursively the specific build functions of the concrete classes. (Lucas)

Action: Replaced nodeKind (String) field from JoanaVertex with enum. Adapted interface of JoanaVertex accordingly.
Reason: All reason why using enum is better when possibility are known at compile-time.  (Lucas)

Action: Replaced edgeKind (String) field from JoanaEdge with enum. Adapted interface of JoanaEdge accordingly.  
Reason: All reason why using enum is better when possibility are known at compile-time.  (Lucas)

Action: SerializedGraph verschoben. Die View wird nun serialized und nicht das model
Reason: View besitzt mehr Information über den Graphen wie Koordinaten -> wichtig für SvgExporter (Jonas F)
